        <h3>HetNet Gateway (HNG)</h3><br>
        <p>The various solutions employed by today’s operators require additional support for signaling and paging optimization. HetNet Gateway does not require additional support as it not only aggregates eNodeBs under its management (along with their corresponding S1 interfaces), but also offers optimized paging. As a result, MME does not have to reach to individual cells for paging and only has to send paging to HNG. HNG would internally employ different techniques to determine the equivalent subset of cell(s) the UE should be paged with. With these advantages, a Service Provider can choose to build larger tracking areas without incurring signaling overload.</p>

    <h2>Most Innovative LTE Service</h2><br>
    <h3>Rural Micro Network Technology</h3><br>
    <p>In the past, the main barrier to offering mobile coverage in remote areas of the UK has been the cost of building large radio towers and laying fiber/cables across the countryside. This new micro network first connects a small station (CWS nodes from Parallel Wireless) via mesh to a nearby macro tower (about 6km), and then extends the coverage and capacity of the tower to the nodes in the valley via backhaul mesh capabilities. Each node in the valley provides access to the community and backhaul connection to neighboring nodes. HetNet Gateway helps with the node configuration, optimization, traffic mitigation, and enables additional level of resilience and improves the economics of connecting hard-to-reach areas via cost-effective mesh.</p>

        <h3>Parallel Wireless and EE Rural Network</h3><br>
        <p>EE and Parallel Wireless have joined forces to deliver award-winning innovation by connecting the previously unconnected in the UK. This 4G wireless broadband service utilizes Parallel Wireless micro network technology to enable EE to deliver reliable 4G LTE coverage across the UK. It uses virtualization principles to deliver consistent, superior LTE performance while changing the economics of cellular rollouts.</p>

    <h2>Small cell access point and design technology</h2><br>
    <h3>Converged Wireless System (CWS)</h3><br>
    <p>Our outdoor Converged Wireless System (CWS-110) base station supports LTE, LTE advanced, and Wi-Fi. CWS hardware is designed from cost-effective components to deliver maximum coverage, scalability and flexibility to build faster, smarter, and more reliable networks.</p><br><br><br>
    <h2>Small cell backhaul design technology</h2><br>
    <h3>Converged Wireless System enabled by HetNet Gateway</h3><br>
    <p>The CWS has multiple backhaul options including mesh enabled by HetNet Gateway (HNG). Backhaul is considered to be one of the top three challenges faced by small cell deployments from cost perspective and the time that fixed backhaul might take to install. HNG manages mesh between CWS units that enables them to connect to each other and the packet core without the need for expensive fiber. The nodes can also daisy chain the network even further to bring low cost wireless broadband to remote areas without any additional expenses.</p>

        <h2>Best Technical Platform based on Network Intelligence for SDN/NFV</h2><br>
        <h3>HetNet Gateway</h3><br>
        <p>HetNet Gateway from Parallel Wireless is the industry’s first 100% 3GPP-compliant, carrier-grade, high-performance NFV- and SDN-based RAN orchestrator that unleashes a dramatic cost advantage while enabling operators to both scale and grow their multi-vendor multi-technology (3G, 4G, and Wi-Fi) networks. HNG virtualizes the RAN interfaces for real-time network management while abstracting RAN changes from the core network and the core network itself from the RAN.
